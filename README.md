# Custom-DT-algorithm
A python code for Decision Tree algorithm. It contains custom functions for the fitting, testing and evaluating the algorithm. 

The code was created in order to understand better the DT algorithm. For that reason it avoids the use of libraries that usually handle the creation of the DT such as sklearn.
